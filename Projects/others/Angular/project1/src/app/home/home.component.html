        In a single-page app, you change what the user sees by showing or hiding portions of the display that correspond to
        particular components, rather than going out to the server to get a new page.
    
        As users perform application tasks, they need to move between the different views that you have defined.
    
        To handle the navigation from one view to the next, you use the Angular Router. The Router enables navigation by
        interpreting a browser URL as an instruction to change the view.
